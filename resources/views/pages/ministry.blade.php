                Ministerial Works

                Just like Paul the apostle, the tent maker, who combined spiritual ministerial job with his secular job, Bishop Kunle Amoo tows this path. He had said; "Theology and Geology are his passions" He has demonstrated this over the years. Bishop Amoo believes in God and has absolute faith that God is love and God is the owner miracles. He has seen and partook of miracles himself. While he was young, he prayed along with some one and a dead baby came up alive. Very recently a water he prayed on was able to wake up a baby born dead on arrival. He has prayed for many sick people and prayed on himself and God healed him. He believes nothing is difficult with God.
                
                Bishop Amoo also do not collect money for spiritual blessings. But he said, "if after you see the hand of God and you want to bless his ministry, why not..God loves a cheerful giver. But we wont ask money to pray for the sick or pray on the anointing oil"
