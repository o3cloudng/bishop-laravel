                            Bishop Kunle Amoo has done over 30 mining and exploration projects which are top class and
                            of global standards.

                            From China to Europe to North America. He is arguably West Africa's prolific field
                            geophysicist/geochemist combined as he embarks on field works monthly ranging from Drone
                            magnetics, ground magnetics, soil sampling, rock sampling, Trenching, shallow drilling as
                            well as electrical methods of prospecting (IP) among others. He is a data scientists and
                            data processing and interpretation is very important to him as this guides clients and saves
                            stress and investments. It is noteworthy to also mention that Bishop Amoo while as a young
                            Geoscientist constructed a device that measures rock remanence and induced magnetization
                            under the tutelage of Dr Fred Fieberg of TBU, Braunschweig, DAAD, German Academic Exchange
                            program Just recently he has created a device named as AMOOFLOAT, for mineral processing and
                            is evaluated patentable in canada under the auspices of York Educational Development
                            Institute. Bishop Amoo continues to develop himself daily and according to Mr. Joe Hinzer,
                            Frontline North American Geologist and President of WGM, Canada ; "Bishop Kunle always has a
                            project to do. He is a resilient and focused geoscientist/entrepreneur. He is tireless"
